The head of drama , Canadian Sydney Newman , was mainly responsible for developing the programme , with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department -LRB- later head of serials -RRB- Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber .

This means that X is the hardest problem in C. -LRB- Since many problems could be equally hard , one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C. -RRB- Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP , in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P = NP is not solved , being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem , \u03a02 , to another problem , \u03a01 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a01 . This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a01 would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a02", "56e1d9fee3433e14004231ce": "\u03a02", "57094b4f9928a814004714fa": "Pick TV", "5727c8863acd2414000dec49": "3 miles", "56e76b8337bdd419002c3f82": "teachers", "56e76b8337bdd419002c3f83": "average workers", "56e76b8337bdd419002c3f80": "42 % of UK teachers experienced occupational stress", "56e76b8337bdd419002c3f81": "42 %", "57273799f1498d1400e8f4c0": "Herbert Bayer", "57273dbbf1498d1400e8f50a": "Beating the Odds", "5725c63438643c19005acca3": "182 million", "57273799f1498d1400e8f4c1": "1962", "5727dc473acd2414000dee45": "three", "5727dc473acd2414000dee44": "The Malkin Athletic Center", "5727dd2e4b864d1900163ebc": "Harvard Crimson men", "5727dd2e4b864d1900163ebb": "Thames River", "5727dd2e4b864d1900163eba": "23", "5727dd2e4b864d1900163ebd": "2003", "57267de1f1498d1400e8e194": "Collingwood Street", "57267de1f1498d1400e8e195": "its concentration of high-end bars", "57267de1f1498d1400e8e196": "12-screen", "57267de1f1498d1400e8e197": "The Pink Triangle", "5726eb8bf1498d1400e8efe3": "when the immune system is less active than normal", "5726eb8bf1498d1400e8efe2": "Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases and cancer", "5733d68ed058e614000b6381": "coast", "5733d68ed058e614000b6380": "Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north , to Georgia in the south .
