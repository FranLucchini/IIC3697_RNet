Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles -LRB- chambers -RRB- that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk . The function of the spiral thread is uncertain , but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape , and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart .

The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed . Euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly -LRB- in 40 to 60 milliseconds -RRB- ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey .

A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers -LRB- the Carmichael numbers -RRB- that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime , so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers . Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers , though , so this test can be useful for practical purposes .

According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report , the wealthiest 1 % owns 46 % of the world 's wealth ; the 85 richest people , a small part of the wealthiest 1 % , own about 0.7 % of the human population 's wealth , which is the same as the bottom half of the population . More recently , in January 2015 , Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016 . An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1 % now own nearly half of the world 's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession . In October 2015 , Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase , and that half of the world 's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile , whose assets each exceed $ 759,900 .
