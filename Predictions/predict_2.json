By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number . In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler -- who did not agree . In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime . For example , Derrick Norman Lehmer 's list of primes up to 10,006,721 , reprinted as late as 1956 , started with 1 as its first prime . Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime . By the early 20th century , mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number , but rather forms its own special category as a `` unit ''", "57297547af94a219006aa45d": "Leonhard Euler", "57297547af94a219006aa45e": "10,006,721", "57297547af94a219006aa45b": "10,006,721", "57297547af94a219006aa45c": "Leonhard Euler", "57269120708984140094ca5c": "cycling promotes healthy living ...

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein , the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs -LRB- not just imported ones -RRB- to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports . German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , but Cassis de Dijon , which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol .

With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity , it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum -LRB- 4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics -RRB- . The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force . Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be `` fundamental interactions '' . :199 -- 128 When particle A emits -LRB- creates -RRB- or absorbs -LRB- annihilates -RRB- virtual particle B , a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A ' exchanging by B . This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions . While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict , in full detail , the accurate result of such interactions , there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams . In a Feynman diagram , each matter particle is represented as a straight line -LRB- see world line -RRB- traveling through time , which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram . Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram . World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices , and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines .

The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule . This language was the forerunner of Modern English ; but while the dialects of other English regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages -- particularly Latin and Norman French -- the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language . An example of this is the pronunciation of certain words : `` dead '' , `` cow '' , `` house '' and `` strong '' are pronounced `` deed '' , `` coo '' , `` hoos '' and `` strang ''", "572fb059947a6a140053cb81": "", "56d7270c0d65d214001983f5": "six", "56d7270c0d65d214001983f4": "six", "56d7270c0d65d214001983f7": "", "56d7270c0d65d214001983f6": "", "56d7270c0d65d214001983f8": "", "57111ab8a58dae1900cd6c40": "", "56e1dc62cd28a01900c67bcb": "", "56e1dc62cd28a01900c67bca": "a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm", "572743fb708984140094db94": "transition to color", "572743fb708984140094db93": "1970s", "56e1dc62cd28a01900c67bce": "Boolean satisfiability problem , the Hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem .

If food is plentiful , they can eat 10 times their own weight per day . While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores , other surface-water species prey on zooplankton -LRB- planktonic animals -RRB- ranging in size from the microscopic , including mollusc and fish larvae , to small adult crustaceans such as copepods , amphipods , and even krill . Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts -LRB- stinging cells -RRB- into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts . Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey -- some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as `` webs '' , some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders , and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread , as bolas spiders do . This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species . The two-tentacled `` cydippid '' Lampea feeds exclusively on salps , close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies , and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow . Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey : Pleurobrachia 's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods , while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller , weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae", "5728dddc2ca10214002da9d6": "lawbreaking , if it is not done publicly , at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience", "5728dddc2ca10214002da9d5": "lawbreaking , if it is not done publicly , at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience .
