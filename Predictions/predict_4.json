The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War . With the beginning of the new era , the after Stalin period called the `` thaw '' , in the late 1950s , the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda . In his speech on the UN conference in 1960 , he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism , stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders . Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist , critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires .

With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity , it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum -LRB- 4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics -RRB- . The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force . Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be `` fundamental interactions '' . :199 -- 128 When particle A emits -LRB- creates -RRB- or absorbs -LRB- annihilates -RRB- virtual particle B , a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A ' exchanging by B . This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions . While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict , in full detail , the accurate result of such interactions , there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams . In a Feynman diagram , each matter particle is represented as a straight line -LRB- see world line -RRB- traveling through time , which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram . Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram .
