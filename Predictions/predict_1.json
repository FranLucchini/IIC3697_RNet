Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism .

The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War . With the beginning of the new era , the after Stalin period called the `` thaw '' , in the late 1950s , the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda . In his speech on the UN conference in 1960 , he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism , stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders . Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist , critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires . Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states . It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control .

The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War . With the beginning of the new era , the after Stalin period called the `` thaw '' , in the late 1950s , the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda .

Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist , critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires . Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states . It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control .

Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria , sister to the Cnidaria , sister to Cnidaria , Placozoa and Bilateria , and sister to all other animal phyla . A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways -LRB- e.g. , homeoboxes , nuclear receptors , the Wnt signaling pathway , and sodium channels -RRB- showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios , that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria , Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla . Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals . This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages -LRB- e.g. , Porifera -RRB- or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage . However , other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes , and that Porifera -LRB- sponges -RRB- is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead .
