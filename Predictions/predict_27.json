The head of drama , Canadian Sydney Newman , was mainly responsible for developing the programme , with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department -LRB- later head of serials -RRB- Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber . Writer Anthony Coburn , story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series . -LSB- note 1 -RSB- The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience , as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history .

He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production , resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable . However , he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes , such as technological innovation , a view shared by other experts . Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality . They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper -- Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes .

In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34 , ` Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States ' . In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all `` trading rules '' that are `` enacted by Member States '' which could hinder trade `` directly or indirectly , actually or potentially '' would be caught by article 34 . This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful . It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville , who could not get certificates from authorities in France , where they bought the Scotch . This `` wide test '' , to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade , applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies , such as the former `` Buy Irish '' company that had government appointees . It also means states can be responsible for private actors . For instance , in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries , and even Belgian tomato imports . France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ` manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage . Generally speaking , if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports -LRB- or exports under TFEU article 35 -RRB- then it must be justified under article 36 .", "5726b718dd62a815002e8dc2": ".", "5729d609af94a219006aa661": "capital equipment for labor inputs", "5729d609af94a219006aa663": "organic composition of capital", "5729d609af94a219006aa662": "competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits", "57272ce1f1498d1400e8f43e": "Helan Mountains", "57272ce1f1498d1400e8f43d": "Yellow River", "57272ce1f1498d1400e8f43c": "Genghis Khan", "57272ce1f1498d1400e8f43b": "1226", "57272ce1f1498d1400e8f43a": "1226", "56f852fba6d7ea1400e1756e": "herring barrels", "56f852fba6d7ea1400e1756d": "Katharina von Bora", "56f852fba6d7ea1400e1756f": "26", "57300f8504bcaa1900d770d1": "", "57300f8504bcaa1900d770d3": "Islamist groups", "57300f8504bcaa1900d770d2": "Saudi monarchy", "56e76d6537bdd419002c3f97": "US", "56e76d6537bdd419002c3f96": "background check and psychiatric evaluation", "56e76d6537bdd419002c3f95": "elementary school education certificate", "56e76d6537bdd419002c3f94": "teach in a school", "56e76d6537bdd419002c3f93": "university or college", "570d50a5fed7b91900d45e7f": "32,463", "570d50a5fed7b91900d45e7e": "24 %", "570d50a5fed7b91900d45e7d": "17 % to $ 8.7 billion", "572863c72ca10214002da2d4": "Mongol and Turkic", "572863c72ca10214002da2d5": "1206", "572863c72ca10214002da2d6": "\u00d6gedei Khan", "572863c72ca10214002da2d7": "1206", "5726c80c5951b619008f7de8": "Korea", "5726c80c5951b619008f7de9": "ivory", "5728e3c33acd2414000e0134": "civil disobedience", "5733fd66d058e614000b6737": "Albany , Montcalm", "56bf59523aeaaa14008c95e3": "Super Bowl 50 Host Committee", "572ffb02b2c2fd14005686b9": "Eocene onwards", "56bf59523aeaaa14008c95e5": "over $ 40 million", "56bf59523aeaaa14008c95e4": "$ 40 million", "572a0a686aef0514001551ef": "Robert Koch and Emil von Behring", "572a0a686aef0514001551ee": "phagocytes", "572a0a686aef0514001551ed": "Elie Metchnikoff", "572a0a686aef0514001551ec": "humoral '' theories of immunity", "572f6ec7a23a5019007fc622": "UNESCO World Heritage Site", "572f6ec7a23a5019007fc621": "viniculture and tourism", "5728683b3acd2414000df9af": "1932", "5727d1c93acd2414000ded3f": "5.3 %", "5733fd66d058e614000b6736": "Ticonderoga", "56e11f05e3433e1400422c31": "linguist", "56e11f05e3433e1400422c30": "asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work .

The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed . Euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly -LRB- in 40 to 60 milliseconds -RRB- ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey .

Richard Harbison 's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic , in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid . Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids . He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like . A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001 , using 26 species , including 4 recently discovered ones , confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like . It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small -- so small that the relationships between the Lobata , Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain . This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent , and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous -- Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished .

On May 7 , 1949 , Billboard revealed that ABC had proposed an investment of $ 6.25 million , of which it would spend $ 2.5 million to convert 20 acres -LRB- 80,937 m2 -RRB- of land in Hollywood into what would become The Prospect Studios", "57267b65dd62a815002e86a6": "Geordie", "572943ab1d0469140077921c": "", "57268525dd62a815002e8806": "November 2006 and May 2008", "57268525dd62a815002e8807": "Old Town Hall , Gateshead", "57268525dd62a815002e8808": "three", "57268525dd62a815002e8809": "Classic", "572f59b4a23a5019007fc589": "Lindau", "571a484210f8ca1400304fbf": "silicon dioxide", "571a484210f8ca1400304fbe": "oxygen", "571a484210f8ca1400304fbd": "8", "570d2af0fed7b91900d45c97": "1", "570d2af0fed7b91900d45c96": "Melbourne", "570d2af0fed7b91900d45c95": "south-east", "570d2af0fed7b91900d45c94": "second-most", "570d2af0fed7b91900d45c93": "south-east of Australia", "57302700a23a5019007fce89": "National Islamic Front", "5726d4a45951b619008f7f69": "British patrons", "56e07c86231d4119001ac1d1": "Tesla Polyphase System", "56e07c86231d4119001ac1d0": "Tesla Polyphase System", "56d9992fdc89441400fdb59e": "Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly", "57268525dd62a815002e880a": "Gateshead", "5726710b708984140094c620": "Queen Victoria and Prince Albert", "56d9992fdc89441400fdb59c": "308", "572943ab1d04691400779219": "", "57302700a23a5019007fce8c": "money from foreign Islamist banking systems", "57302700a23a5019007fce8b": "National Islamic Front", "5726d4a45951b619008f7f6d": "porcelain , cloth and wallpaper", "5726d4a45951b619008f7f6b": "Horace Walpole", "5726d4a45951b619008f7f6c": "Horace Walpole", "5726d4a45951b619008f7f6a": "Asia", "57281a952ca10214002d9dee": "The Talons of Weng-Chiang", "56e0fa5b7aa994140058e85c": "metal", "5725b56589a1e219009abd21": "Gemini program", "5725b56589a1e219009abd20": "1961 to 1972", "5725b56589a1e219009abd23": "Skylab", "5725b56589a1e219009abd22": "Soviet Union", "57283c464b864d19001647c8": "private research university", "57276d7f708984140094dd3f": "Cleveland and Pittsburgh", "5726a21bf1498d1400e8e579": "Yes\u00fcgei", "5726a21bf1498d1400e8e578": "Del\u00fc\u00fcn Boldog", "573062662461fd1900a9cdfa": "othering", "57296de03f37b3190047839e": "1962", "57296de03f37b3190047839d": "increase the chloroplast 's surface area for cross-membrane transport", "571a50df4faf5e1900b8a963": "Oxygen", "57296de03f37b3190047839b": "chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots", "572ff56304bcaa1900d76f2f": "two ninths", "572ff56304bcaa1900d76f2d": "IJssel and Nederrijn", "572ff56304bcaa1900d76f2e": "IJssel and Nederrijn", "56de11154396321400ee25aa": "Norman mercenary origin", "57290ee2af94a219006aa002": "either of the parties withdraws from the deal before then", "57268bf9dd62a815002e890b": "", "57290ee2af94a219006aa001": "PNU and ODM camps depending on each party 's strength in Parliament", "57300c67947a6a140053cff1": "Knaurs Lexikon", "57300c67947a6a140053cff0": "1,230 kilometres", "56bf10f43aeaaa14008c9500": "24 -- 10", "56bf10f43aeaaa14008c9501": "February 7 , 2016", "5726e9c65951b619008f8248": "Ancient Egypt", "573062662461fd1900a9cdf7": "diplomacy or military force", "57281cb22ca10214002d9e1f": "third and fourth", "573062662461fd1900a9cdf8": "", "5729a26d6aef05140015505d": "local-global", "5729a26d6aef05140015505b": "p", "57281cb22ca10214002d9e1e": "Six", "5729a26d6aef05140015505a": "p", "5725cda338643c19005acd3f": "North American Aviation", "572a070c6aef0514001551c8": "full stomachs , access to clean water and warmth from fuel", "57302cd004bcaa1900d772da": "participated in the Iraqi insurgency", "5729d36b1d0469140077960a": ".", "5729d36b1d0469140077960b": ".", "57302cd004bcaa1900d772db": "terrorist organisation", "5726356938643c19005ad301": "first-in , first-out buffering", "5726356938643c19005ad300": "first-in , first-out buffering", "56e0bb9f7aa994140058e6cf": "achievements and showmanship", "56e0bb9f7aa994140058e6cd": "magnetic flux density the tesla", "56e0bb9f7aa994140058e6ce": "7 January 1943", "56e0bb9f7aa994140058e6cb": "achievements and showmanship , eventually earning him a reputation in popular culture as an archetypal `` mad scientist '' .

An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1 % now own nearly half of the world 's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession . In October 2015 , Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase , and that half of the world 's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile , whose assets each exceed $ 759,900 .

Two S-II engines shut down prematurely , but the remaining engines were able to compensate . The damage to the third stage engine was more severe , preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection . Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4 . Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems , NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men , cancelling a third unmanned test",

Heading home , Subutai 's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman -- Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus ' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols ' actions in the area . Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace , but the emissaries were executed . At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223 , Subutai 's forces defeated the larger Kievan force . They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars . There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir , writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event . Various historical secondary sources - Morgan , Chambers , Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars , Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the -LRB- recently crushed -RRB- Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory . The Russian princes then sued for peace .

He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production , resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable . However , he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes , such as technological innovation , a view shared by other experts . Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality . They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper -- Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes . Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15 % of rising income inequality .
