Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism . However , after Lenin 's death , Joseph Stalin established ` socialism in one country ' for the Soviet Union , creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements . The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War . With the beginning of the new era , the after Stalin period called the `` thaw '' , in the late 1950s , the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda . In his speech on the UN conference in 1960 , he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism , stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders . Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist , critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires . Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states . It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control .

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein , the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs -LRB- not just imported ones -RRB- to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports . German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , but Cassis de Dijon , which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol . The Court of Justice rejected the German government 's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36 , because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought . This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product 's content or packaging . In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34 , and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection .

The justification for this `` democratic deficit '' under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts , while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war .

It was shortly appropriated by supporters of `` imperialism '' such as Joseph Chamberlain . For some , imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy ; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest , and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed . Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term . Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism , the Highest Stage of Capitalism . In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment , material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion . This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians . Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of `` imperialism '' . Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy , nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century , but a world system extending over a period of centuries , often going back to Christopher Columbus and , in some accounts , to the Crusades .

In the first major case in 1964 , Costa v ENEL , a Milanese lawyer , and former shareholder of an energy company , named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel , as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations .

The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force from 1958 , Costa had no claim . By contrast , the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim , not Mr Costa . However , in principle , Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law , and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision .

Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts -LRB- stinging cells -RRB- into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts .

This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species .

It has been the focus of debate for many years . Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria , sister to the Cnidaria , sister to Cnidaria , Placozoa and Bilateria , and sister to all other animal phyla . A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways -LRB- e.g. , homeoboxes , nuclear receptors , the Wnt signaling pathway , and sodium channels -RRB- showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios , that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria , Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla . Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals . This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages -LRB- e.g. , Porifera -RRB- or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage . However , other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes , and that Porifera -LRB- sponges -RRB- is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead .
