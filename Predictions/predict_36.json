If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular DNA or broken circles , then a D-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate . At the same time , homologous recombination does not expand the multiple A -- > G gradients seen in plastomes . Because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpDNA , the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpDNA is circular and most likely replicates via a D loop mechanism", "5727d9c43acd2414000dee19": "8th", "56f8907faef23719006261b4": "Protestant nobles", "572803493acd2414000df22b": "", "57273b69dd62a815002e99d8": "CBS", "570d418dfed7b91900d45dc0": "Legislative Council", "570d418dfed7b91900d45dc1": "Linda Dessau", "571a52cb4faf5e1900b8a969": "", "571a52cb4faf5e1900b8a968": "Concentrated O 2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically .

An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1 % now own nearly half of the world 's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession .

More recently , in January 2015 , Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016 . An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1 % now own nearly half of the world 's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession . In October 2015 , Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase , and that half of the world 's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile , whose assets each exceed $ 759,900 .

The opening pages contain a diagram of Pascal 's triangle", "5728804b4b864d1900164a49": "polynomial", "572a0b0b6aef0514001551f7": "MHC class I molecules", "572a0b0b6aef0514001551f6": "cancers", "5730876a396df9190009617b": "races", "56e7714a00c9c71400d7713a": "teaching through the Irish language", "57268885dd62a815002e886a": "6 miles", "57277585708984140094de2f": "comedies and family-oriented series", "57268885dd62a815002e886c": "20 minutes", "57268885dd62a815002e886b": "6 miles -LRB- 9.7 km -RRB-", "57268885dd62a815002e886e": "90", "57268885dd62a815002e886d": "five million", "5730b5cc396df919000962d3": "1999", "5728151b4b864d1900164428": "governmental entities", "5728151b4b864d1900164429": "international organizations and foreign governments", "56f81393aef2371900625da9": "January 1519", "572ffbaa947a6a140053cee8": "Western governments bulwarks against", "572ffbaa947a6a140053cee9": "mujahideen Muslim Afghanistan", "572ffbaa947a6a140053cee6": "During the 1970s", "572ffbaa947a6a140053cee7": "dangerous enemies", "56d9895ddc89441400fdb50e": "golden anniversary", "57275650708984140094dc5f": "720p high definition", "56e101f4e3433e1400422a8e": "", "56f89a959b226e1400dd0c9d": "Qur ` an", "56e101f4e3433e1400422a8f": "stock market crash", "56e756bc37bdd419002c3e95": "Co-teaching", "56f81393aef2371900625dad": "Jan Hus", "56e756bc37bdd419002c3e97": "cognitive potential", "56e756bc37bdd419002c3e96": "two", "56f81393aef2371900625daa": "silent", "56f81393aef2371900625dac": "scripture", "56f81393aef2371900625dab": "the Elector", "572867543acd2414000df9a1": "fifteen", "572867543acd2414000df9a2": "fifteen fraternities and seven", "572867543acd2414000df9a3": "Alpha Phi Omega", "56e756bc37bdd419002c3e99": "social", "56e756bc37bdd419002c3e98": "providing a social networking support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential", "56e7714a00c9c71400d77137": "seniority", "56e7714a00c9c71400d77139": "$ 27,814 p.a.", "56e7714a00c9c71400d77138": "$ 27,814 p.a.", "572826762ca10214002d9f30": "20:00 E/P", "572fad30a23a5019007fc871": "1978", "572fad30a23a5019007fc870": "1974", "5729727baf94a219006aa43b": "algebra", "56f8afbc9b226e1400dd0e07": "three years", "56f8afbc9b226e1400dd0e06": "1543", "56f8afbc9b226e1400dd0e05": "Von den Juden und Ihren L\u00fcgen", "572972f46aef051400154ef3": "stems", "56f8afbc9b226e1400dd0e09": "the devil 's people", "56f8afbc9b226e1400dd0e08": "violent , vile language .
