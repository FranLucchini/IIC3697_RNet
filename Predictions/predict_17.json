In practice , equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament can not initiate legislation against the Commission 's wishes , citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries , and `` qualified majorities '' or consensus of the Council are required to legislate . The justification for this `` democratic deficit '' under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts , while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war .

It was shortly appropriated by supporters of `` imperialism '' such as Joseph Chamberlain . For some , imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy ; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest , and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed . Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term . Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism , the Highest Stage of Capitalism . In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment , material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion . This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians . Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of `` imperialism '' . Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy , nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century , but a world system extending over a period of centuries , often going back to Christopher Columbus and , in some accounts , to the Crusades .

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein , the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs -LRB- not just imported ones -RRB- to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports . German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , but Cassis de Dijon , which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol . The Court of Justice rejected the German government 's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36 , because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought . This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product 's content or packaging . In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34 , and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection .

He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome , and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267 . The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force from 1958 , Costa had no claim . By contrast , the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim , not Mr Costa . However , in principle , Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law , and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision .
