As originally written , the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors . When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any `` bug-eyed monsters '' .

In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34 , ` Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States ' . In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all `` trading rules '' that are `` enacted by Member States '' which could hinder trade `` directly or indirectly , actually or potentially '' would be caught by article 34 . This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful . It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville , who could not get certificates from authorities in France , where they bought the Scotch . This `` wide test '' , to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade , applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies , such as the former `` Buy Irish '' company that had government appointees . It also means states can be responsible for private actors . For instance , in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries , and even Belgian tomato imports . France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ` manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage .

More recently , in January 2015 , Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016 . An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1 % now own nearly half of the world 's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession . In October 2015 , Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase , and that half of the world 's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile , whose assets each exceed $ 759,900 . A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined .", "572fe60fb2c2fd140056858c": "Germany , Switzerland and Austria", "572fe60fb2c2fd140056858b": "three", "572a1ba46aef05140015528f": "informal form through various associations and other arrangements", "5711475ca58dae1900cd6d8a": "90 \u00b0", "5711475ca58dae1900cd6d8b": "90 \u00b0", "5711475ca58dae1900cd6d8c": "90 \u00b0", "5729d36b1d04691400779608": ".", "5729d36b1d04691400779609": ".", "56e0bcc0231d4119001ac36c": "\u0110uka Tesla", "56e0d810231d4119001ac432": "1886", "56e0d810231d4119001ac433": "attorney", "5705eee952bb8914006896e1": "Compromise of 1850", "56e0d810231d4119001ac436": "Western Union", "56e0d810231d4119001ac434": "Alfred S.

The Court of Justice held that Denmark 's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd 's freedom of establishment and could not be justified , because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there , and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection . This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition , and a race to the bottom in standards , like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards , and low corporate taxes as a result .
