According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report , the wealthiest 1 % owns 46 % of the world 's wealth ; the 85 richest people , a small part of the wealthiest 1 % , own about 0.7 % of the human population 's wealth , which is the same as the bottom half of the population . More recently , in January 2015 , Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016 . An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1 % now own nearly half of the world 's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession . In October 2015 , Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase , and that half of the world 's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile , whose assets each exceed $ 759,900 .
