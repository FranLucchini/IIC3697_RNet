Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be `` fundamental interactions '' . :199 -- 128 When particle A emits -LRB- creates -RRB- or absorbs -LRB- annihilates -RRB- virtual particle B , a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A ' exchanging by B .
